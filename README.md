# Shopping Cart Unit Tests

This repository contains the example code for Chapter 5 in Andrew Knight's book, *The Way To Test Software*.
It contains a Python unit test example project named `shopping_cart` that tests code for a (fictitious) shopping cart.
The project shows how to write unit tests for callables and classes,
as well as how to fake dependencies with mocks and patches.
Even though this project's primary purpose is to provide example code for the book,
it can be a general example for good Python unit testing practices.
